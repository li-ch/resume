summary = "Datacenters exists because of a standalone server/rack can no longer meet the requirements of modern day applications: web search, ad recommendation, online commerce, machine learning, etc. Different from traditional networks, data center networks enjoy high bandwidth, low latency, and minimal packet loss. These features, however, are not fully utilized today, because application developers are usually unfamiliar with datacenter environment and/or networking stack and its tuning. We aim to design a system for application developers to access networking functions in datacenters and unlock its full potential."
